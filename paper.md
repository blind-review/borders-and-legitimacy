# Why borders sometimes matter

Many accounts of democratic legitimacy justify the political authority of a democratic state on the grounds that democracies produce good outcomes, however defined.  On these accounts, a democratic authority is a legitimate authority, just in case its procedures track the truth, realise individual preferences, or transform the moral character of its participants better than competing forms of government.  Call these accounts of democratic legitimacy _instrumentalist_.

For many instrumentalist accounts, who the people are - who constitutes the demos - seems to play an important role in the outcomes that democratic procedures produce.  Despite this however, the vast majority of political theorists focus their normative attentions on the _kratos_ while neglecting the _demos_ of democracy.  This is a mistake because for instrumentalist accounts of democratic legitimacy, borders matter.  Sometimes.

So I'd like to explore the relationship between democratic authority and democratic inclusion.  In doing so, I'm going to advance three primary claims: firstly, the relatively straight forward notion that inclusion matters to some accounts of legitimacy; secondly, the more original claim that different accounts of legitimacy require differing, sometimes incompatible accounts of inclusion; and lastly as a result of the second claim, that different accounts of legitimacy that have incompatible accounts of inclusion are themselves incompatible.

To advance these claims will require a somewhat novel approach to philosophical argument, but one that I hope becomes increasing common - computer simulation.  The counter factual nature of the relationship between democratic inclusion and democratic legitimacy - the claim that if the accidents of history had drawn the borders of one democratic state elsewhere, then the outcomes any democratic process within that state would have been different - make empiric analysis of the relationship impossible.  So in order to overcome these epistemic limitations, I will construct an agent based model of a hypothetical democracy and use Monte Carlo simulation to examine the impact that different borders have on democratic outcomes.


## The boundary problem of democratic theory

Inclusion matters for instrumentalist justifications of democracy.  Consider for a moment the following idealisation of a recent question in political theory:

> Should Crimea secede from the Ukraine and form a political union with Russia?

Assume for a moment (the unlikely premise) that all parties are committed democrats - that is, they all have strong _prima facie_ convictions to popular sovereignty, political equality, and the rule of law.  And assume further (the even more unlikely premise) that all parties have agreed to some democratic decision mechanism, say a simple majority vote.  Even under these most optimistic conditions, the outcome of any referendum on the question of secession will simply be a function of who is permitted to vote in the referendum.  

If only Crimeans get a say, then the outcome given the pro-Russian preference of most Crimeans, will be something like a 60/40 split in favour of secession.  If all Ukrainians are given a voice however, then the referendum will fail.  And if both Russians and Ukrainians are granted suffrage, then the outcome will be a foregone conclusion for a merger.  

Who gets to vote determines the outcome of that vote, regardless of the democratic process used.  And if the legitimacy of democratic authority is a function of the outcomes that democratic procedures produce, then who is included in a democratic process becomes a key factor in the legitimacy or illegitimacy of that authority.  Borders matter for democracy.

So if we accept that inclusion affects the outcomes of democratic processes, and instrumentalist accounts of democratic legitimacy rely on the quality of those processes, then it is clear that some appropriate justification of democratic inclusion is required.  But how might one define the demos and justify democratic inclusion?

To briefly summarise the literature on why this is the case: Historical accounts are too arbitrary; those based on nationality, cultural, or linguistic salience lack sufficiently objective criteria. The all-coerced principle doesn’t answer the question-that all those subjected to the coercive force of the state should have some say in its operation is a plausible claim but fails to explain who should be subjected to those coercive forces in the first place.  [!more]

[!more]: More detail needed. 1-2 paras per point at least

The challenge of adequately justifying democratic inclusion - of properly defining the demos - has become known as _the boundary problem of democratic theory_ [^naming].  As @simmons [p329] describes it:  

> The boundary problem is the problem faced by such a theory of providing an argument that draws the “boundaries” of political obligation, political authority, and territorial sovereignty in the correct place.  

It is a problem that has garnered a small but growing focus amongst political philosophers and theorists, and one that currently seems intractable.

[^naming]: Who has called it what?



"How to decide who
legitimately make up ‘the people,’” writes Robert Dahl, “is a problem
almost totally neglected by all the great political philosophers who write
about democracy."



....who and how they have addressed it....

Regardless of how democratic inclusion is justified, one essential requirement of such a justification is that it complements, or is at least congruent with, accounts of democratic legitimacy.  And while current democratic literature lacks any details on exactly which accounts of inclusion are compatible with which accounts of legitimacy, it is clearly within the realm of possibility that one may be incompatible with the other.

## Modelling Inclusion

- explain how the relationship between inclusion and authority can be examined
- explain how different accounts of inclusion are simulated

One reason that the specifics of the Boundary Problem have received such little attention is the paucity of empiric evidence to examine.  The Boundary Problem is a _what if_ problem; it's counter-factual nature, that if the accidents of history had consigned the boarders of some state elsewhere, then the people of that state would have decided differently, makes contrastive evaluations difficult.


Generative approaches by contrast offer hope.....

By using computer simulation to model different examples of inclusion, we can examine how these different ways of drawing borders between political associations affects the outcomes of democratic procedures within them.

To do this, we will construct an agent based model of a hypothetical world and use Monte Carlo simulation 





## Epistemic Virtue

- borders matter - large and homogeneous


## Preference Realisation

- borders matter - small and heterogeneous

Call this fidelity with the will of the people / general will

Which political procedures legitimately articulate the will of the people cannot itself be wholly determined by interrogating the people’s will - see @abizadeh2012 p875 & See (Derrida 1984; Habermas 2001a; Holmes 1988; Honig 2007; Michelman 1997).

>  Another consequentialist argument for majority rule is utilitarian rather than epistemic. It does not require the existence of an independent fact or state of the world that the collective decision is supposed to track. Suppose each voter gets some utility from the collective decision, which depends on whether the decision matches his or her vote (preference): specifically, each voter gets a utility of 1 from a match between his or her vote and the collective outcome and a utility of 0 from a mismatch.[3] The Rae-Taylor theorem then states that if each individual has an equal prior probability of preferring each of the two alternatives, majority rule maximizes each individual's expected utility (see, e.g., Mueller 2003).

> Relatedly, majority rule minimizes the number of frustrated voters (defined as voters on the losing side) and maximizes total utility across voters. Brighouse and Fleurbaey (2010) generalize this result. Define voter i's stake in the decision, di, as the utility difference between his or her preferred outcome and his or her dispreferred outcome. The Rae-Taylor theorem rests on an implicit equal-stakes assumption, i.e., di = 1 for every i ∈ N. Brighouse and Fleurbaey show that when stakes are allowed to vary across voters, total utility is maximized not by majority rule, but by a weighted majority rule, where each individual i's voting weight wi is proportional to his or her stake di.

## Moral Transformation

- borders don't matter


## Discussion

- the relationship between democratic inclusion and democratic legitimacy and their compatibility or lack there of means that some accounts of democratic authority are incompatible with each other
