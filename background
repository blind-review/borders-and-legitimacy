1. background
  - there are many justifications of democracy (where does democracy's value come from)
  - some are consequentialist
  - these rely on outcomes
  - outcomes are determined by inclusion
  - there's no good way of determining inclusion

2. investigation
  - what is the relationship between inclusion and democracy's value
  - consequentialist accounts of democracy require accounts of democratic inclusion
  - different accounts of democracy require accounts of democratic inclusion
  - incompatible accounts of inclusion render some accounts of democracy themselves incompatible

3. methods
  - create a simple computer model of democracy
  - a space, agents, beliefs, polities
  - show relationship between democracy and inclusion
