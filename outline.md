Democracy means rule of the people.  Democratic theory typically concerns itself with the nature of the ruling, rather than the nature of the people.  This is a mistake.  Who the people are, and more importantly who they ought to be, has a profound impact on a number of justifications of democratic authority.

This paper critically examines the relationship between accounts of democratic inclusion and accounts of democratic authority. Using computer simulation, I show that for instrumentalist accounts of democracy at least, accounts of democratic authority must be compatible with accounts of democratic inclusions, and that different accounts of democratic authority require differing, and incompatible accounts of democratic inclusion.


## Introduction

Specify central claims:

- accounts of democratic authority must be compatible with accounts of democratic inclusion
  - this places additional demands on accounts of democratic authority that are not currently addressed
- different accounts of authority require differing, sometimes incompatible accounts of inclusion
- different accounts of authority that have incompatible accounts of inclusion are themselves incompatible



## Lit review

- cosmopolitanism
- boundary problem


## The Model

- how I am going to test my claim
- what the model details


## Epistemic Justifications


## Preference Realisation Justifications


## Transformative Justifications


- inclusion matters to some accounts of legitimacy
  - some accounts of legitimacy rely on a particular quality of outcomes
  - who is included in a democratic process affects the quality of outcomes
  - therefore accounts of legitimacy must have congruent accounts of inclusion

- different accounts of legitimacy require differing, sometimes incompatible accounts of inclusion

- different accounts of legitimacy that have incompatible accounts of inclusion are themselves incompatible

Some accounts of democracy justify it with reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.  We can characterise these into three groups

  - good consequences are relative to some independent criteria
  - good consequences are relative to some dependent criteria
  - good consequences are indifferent of the content of the outcome

But who is included in a democratic process plays a fundamental role in the outcome of that process.

And there is no good way of determining democratic inclusion.

This presents a problem for consequentialist justifications of democracy

Key claims:

  - accounts of democratic authority must be compatible with accounts of democratic inclusion
  - different accounts of authority require differing, sometimes incompatible accounts of inclusion
  - different accounts of authority that have incompatible accounts of inclusion are themselves incompatible

## Who are the people

- consequentialist account of democracy requires certain outcomes
- outcomes are a function of inclusion
- inclusion has no good answers

Segway - is this true in all cases? in all conditions? Justify simulation

- any consequentialist account of democracy must be compatible with accounts of democratic inclusion 
- different accounts of authority require differing, sometimes incompatible accounts of inclusion
- different accounts of authority that have incompatible accounts of inclusion are themselves incompatible
