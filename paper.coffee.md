# What's the Problem with the Boundary Problem?

### Outline

I'm going to model the boundary problem and how it affects difference making accounts of democracy.  I will look at a number of variables that may influence the problem:

- number of polities
- clustering of agent belief
- level of belief polarisation

I'll also assess the impact of the boundary problem upon various accounts of democracy, namely:

- epistemic accounts that seek to identify an objectively correct answer
- preference aggregation via simple majority vote
- autonomy realisation accounts via the matching of individual preference to collective choice

### The Model

Modelling the Boundary Problem begins by identifying the relevant components and how they relate to each other.  

Because the Boundary Problem concerns the justifications of political boundaries, typically states, the conceptual space for the analysis is necessarily inter-entity.  I'll model this as the _political space_ - then domain that contains one or more political entities.


### Assessment

We'll assess the model against a variety of democratic accounts.  The purpose of the assessment is to determine the likelihood (via simulation) of the results from a polity changing purely because of who is included within it - ie. the causal role of inclusion on outcomes.
