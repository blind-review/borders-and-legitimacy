# What's the Problem with the Boundary Problem?

### Objective

I'm going to model the boundary problem and how it affects difference making accounts of democracy.  I will look at a number of variables that may influence the problem such as:

- number of polities
- clustering of agent belief
- level of belief polarisation

I'll also assess the impact of the boundary problem upon various accounts of democracy, namely:

- epistemic accounts that seek to identify an objectively correct answer
- preference aggregation via simple majority vote
- autonomy realisation accounts via the matching of individual preference to collective choice

### The Model

Modelling the Boundary Problem begins by identifying the relevant components and how they relate to each other.  

Because the Boundary Problem concerns the justifications of political boundaries, typically states, the conceptual space for the analysis is necessarily inter-entity.  I'll model this as the _political space_ - then domain that contains one or more political entities.


### Assessment

We'll assess the model against a variety of democratic accounts.  The purpose of the assessment is to determine the likelihood (via simulation) of the results from a polity changing purely because of who is included within it - ie. the causal role of inclusion on outcomes.


### Outline

I'll start with a brief introduction to the Boundary Problem.  Very briefly, the Boundary Problem relates to the inability of democratic theory to adequately justify who _ought_ be included amongst _the people_.  It's easy enough to conceptualise: 

> Any democratic process assumes the existence of some determinant group of people whose existence holds logical and temporal priority to their collective action.  Attempting to answer the question of who _ought_ be included amongst the people democratically is either viciously circular or reliant upon some non-democratic process.

The Boundary Problem is really three related problems.  The first issue is the _Justification Problem_ which concerns justifying political inclusion.  It cannot be solved democratically and all extra-democratic attempts have been unsatisfactory.  The next issue is the _Value Problem_ which relates the clash of substantive principles between democracy's intended realisation of self rule, and the heteronomy that results from incorrectly defining the demos.

The third issue is the _Predetermination Problem_ which affects a number of consequential and instrumental accounts of democratic authority.  Any democratic account that relies on difference making as the source of political legitimacy must, necessarily, show that democracy plays a causal role in bringing about a particular state of affairs.  Yet who the people are often predetermines the outcome of any democratic processes, thereby undermining the causal role of democracy.

Next, I'll briefly survey the role of simulation in philosophy and social science.  Simulation is a formalised approach to argumentation displays characteristics of both empiricist and and rationalist enquiry.  It can provide observational data like experimental studies but the data is fully constrained by the assumptions of the model.

Finally, I'll develop a model of the boundary problem, generate data via Montecarlo simulation, and make probabilistic inferences about the extent of the affect the various parameters have on different democratic accounts.
