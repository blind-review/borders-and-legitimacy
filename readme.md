# Doing Philosophy with Git & Coffeescript

This is an attempt to fully use git vcs in the process of writing an academic paper. My aim is to find a balance between the 'publish early, publish often' and open-history mantras of open source software development; the many wrong turns and dead ends that characterise research; and tendency of many in academia to [only publish polished work][1], lest we be judged poorly on our early ideas.

My initial idea is to explore how branching can be used to find this balance.  The `public` branch will represent relatively solid work to date - work that I'm happy to have others freely link to and fork if the wish. Think of this as the production branch in software development.  

The `draft` branch will be my primary work-in-progress branch.  I'll create separate branches from this for particular ideas and directions I want to head down, and update the public branch from it when I'm happy with the work.

Hopefully, this will mean that only the `public` branch will be visible, unless of course someone goes diving into the branches and history.  And if that's the case, it should be obvious that they are looking at raw ideas.

## About the paper

The content of this paper will also be pretty unique.  I'll be modelling a foundational problem in democratic theory using computer simulations to generate probability functions in order to shed light on the extend and nature of the problem.  You can read the [abstract here](/abstract.md/). And because I'll be using Literal Coffeescript, the paper will also be the code for the simulation.  Pretty sweet eh?


## Presentations

I presented a work-in-progress to the Munich Centre for Mathematical Philosophy on 23 Apr 2014.  A copy of the [presentation](munich.coffee.md) is now available here and (shortly) on iTunes University.
