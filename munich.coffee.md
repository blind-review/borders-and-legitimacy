# The Problem


----


> Should Crimea secede from the Ukraine and form a political union with Russia?


----


## _Who_  determines _what_.


----


### _Who the people are_ 
### is logically and temporally prior to the question of 
### _what they decide_.



----


1. Inclusion is of fundamental importance to democracy
2. Inclusion can't be solved democratically
3. That non-democratic solutions are incompatible with democratic legitimacy


----


> "curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem" p59.  


----


1. The problem exists
2. The problem is self-evident or obvious
3. Why solutions are (in)compatible

        if votes.hasOwnProperty agent.belief then votes[agent.belief]++ else votes[agent.belief] = 1       
      max = Math.max.apply null, (num for belief, num of votes)
      votes.winner = belief for belief, num of votes when num is max
      votes

    epistemicVirtue = (space) ->
      correctVotes = 0
      for polity in space.polities
        election = vote polity
        correctVotes += 1 if election.winner is 'right'
      correctVotes / space.polities.length

    simulateEpistemicDemocracy = (agents, partitions, clustering, trials) ->
      space = new Space( agents, clustering )

- [1000 agents 51% correct 500 trials - cluster strength](graphs/epi-51-clustering.html)


----


## Implications


----


- increasing polity numbers decreases the likelihood of a correct outcome
- especially true with lower population polities
- changes in the numbers of partitions can be explained CJT effect
- changes in partition makeup can't (ie clustered partitons)


----


- an epistemic account of inclusion would be satisfied by a requirement of sufficiently many informed voted
- but this only applies when we have uniform or random distribution of agent beliefs
- strong clustering of beliefs undermines the episitemic value of voting
- the boundary problem is present with clustered spaces

#  Strategic 
# Justifications

```

    fidelity = (space) ->
      winners = 0
      population = 0
      for polity in space.polities
        election = vote polity
        for key, val of election
          winners += val if key is election.winner
          population += val unless key is 'winner'
      winners / population 
    
    simulateStrategicDemocracy = (agents, partitions, clustering, trials) ->
      space = new Space( agents, clustering )
      results = { 'a': agents, 'p': partitions, 'c': clustering, 'trials': [] }
      for num in [1..trials]
        results.trials.push fidelity space.partition partitions       
      results

- [1000 agents 51% correct 500 trials - cluster strength](graphs/stg-51-clustering.html)


----

 
## Implications


----


- increasing polities increases the likelihood of individual agent preference being realised
- especially true in smaller populations
- effect increases as clustering increases
- polity number has opposing effects for epistemic vs strategic accounts

---


# Limitations


----


- only models a narrow range of democratic accounts & procedures
- only applies to the predetermination problem
- could be extended to deliberation & sortition
- could be extended to alternate accounts of democracy
- using polity number as primary variable makes interpretation non obvious


---


# Conclusion


----


- the impact of the Boundary Problem is not obvious
- how the effect of partitioning depends of the democratic account
- this can only be said about difference making accounts of democracy
- conflict between epistemic and strategic accounts of democracy
